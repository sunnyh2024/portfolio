        Welcome! before you explore the rest of my portfolio, here‚Äôs some more
        about me. I grew up in a small town in Central Massachusetts, and just
        graduated from Northeastern University in May 2024. I‚Äôm currently a
        software engineer at Capital One, where I automate workflows for the
        Cyber division. Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, traveling, and
        listening to music (listening to a lot of 88rising Niki, k-pop, and
        house right now). This past summer, I made a long overdue trip to Asia
        to visit family, which got me into all sorts of tea. I‚Äôm currently
        trying to experiment with different oat milks to make the best matcha
        latte, but I have a lot more tea sitting on my shelf to try out!

          I try to stay curious, and am always open to learning something new. I
          am a newly certified AWS Solutions Architect, and I am also
          experimenting with Figma to learn more about design. My current goal
          for these next couple years is to continue diversifying my work
          experiences and figuring out what I enjoy doing.
