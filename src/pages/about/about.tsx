        Hey! before you explore the rest of my portfolio, here’s some more about
        me. I grew up in a small town in Central Massachusetts, and just
        graduated from Northeastern University in May 2024. I’m currently a
        software engineer at Capital One, where I automate workflows for the
        Cyber division. Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, traveling, and
        listening to music (I love Niki and am getting into k-pop too). This
        past summer, I made a long overdue trip to Asia to visit family, which
        got me into tea, and now I’m trying to experiment with different oat
        milks to make matcha lattes.

          I try to stay curious, and am always open to learning something new.
          I’m currently pursuing an AWS Solutions Architect Certification and
          using Figma to learn more about design. I want to continue
          diversifying my work experiences and figuring out what I enjoy.
